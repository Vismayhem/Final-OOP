Welcome to the final project of OOP. This java project is a collaboration between 4 members who have designed and tested a virtual ATM machine program. The program will allow you to do many things such as managing your balance, logging in, and having a built-in security feature to show you your correct password with a recovery catchphrase.
The list of the features can be found below:
-          Sign in: the ability to sign into the program (the account is pre-defined so you must enter your credentials correctly; Username is Henry, Password is OOPisFun123)
-          Recovery: Should you enter your password or username incorrectly the program will ask for a recovery catchphrase (in this case its “Sparky”) which is case sensitive.
-          Menu Methods: here you will have access to the 5 main functions which are
o   Check balance: check your current account balance by pressing 1
o   Deposit: store money into your account by pressing 2
o   Withdraw: take money out of your account by pressing 3
o   Exchange currency: Exchange your currency from USD to Canadian ( press 6) or British pounds (press 7). Your new currency which is converted should be printed and you can see exchange rates during the program execution as well.
o   Logout: a simple logout function to exit the ATM session.




We've tested the OOP ATM thoroughly in class with our professor and we are proud to say we were able to pass all of our edge cases efficiently. We never thought we would be able to code an ATM machine after taking this class and it was so fun to be able to create one! Thank you for helping us with the project and we hope you enjoy your holidays professor!!
